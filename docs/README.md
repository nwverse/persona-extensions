## Using extensions

- [Installation](installation.md): register the public market, install local packages and handle older hubs.
- [GitHub](extensions/github.md): the inbox, knowledge-base archive, assistant tools and sign-in of the GitHub connector (moved out of the hub), and a GitHub page: what needs you, repositories and their code, and PR / issue review.
- [Home Assistant](extensions/homeassistant.md): areas, devices, controls and history from your own Home Assistant; the logbook, statistics and energy, automations, calls by area, speakers, cameras, watch rules that notify or wake the assistant, confirmed assistant writes, writable domains and the sandbox.
- [Hacker News](extensions/hackernews.md): public Top, New, Best, Ask HN and Show HN stories, top-level comments, filtering, the localized app view and assistant tools.
- [Termwise](extensions/termwise.md): a reading page with translation mode and vocabulary mode. Vocabulary mode underlines candidate words; choosing one shows the gloss and can remember it.
- [Search as Code](extensions/search-as-code.md): executable Search-as-Code pipelines over local coding-agent session transcripts and repositories (`\|>` operators for `Without tools` conversational filtering, regex matching, cross-session file correlation, grouping and ranking), with step execution traces, reusable search recipes and a local MCP server (`search-as-code mcp`).
- [LINUX DO](extensions/linuxdo.md): public topics, filtering, request limits and the app view.
- [Sentry](extensions/sentry.md): the errors and crashes of the hub, the web and the apps, scrubbed by the hub, sent to your Sentry project; events, settings, limits and network.
- [V2EX](extensions/v2ex.md): public hot, latest and followed-node topics, filtering, request limits and the app view.
- [Feishu Sidebar](extensions/feishu-sidebar.md): open the user's Persona web from a Feishu sidebar through a built applink (no Feishu app, no requests, no credentials), and an assistant tool for the same link.
- [RSSHub](extensions/rsshub.md): subscribe to RSSHub routes or any RSS, Atom or JSON feed on the public or your own instance (with its access key); the navigation page with unread entries, tags and route previews, the background refresh with ETag caching, assistant tools with confirmed subscription changes, and the sandbox.
- [Weather](extensions/weather.md): Open-Meteo's current weather, next-24-hours line, 7-day forecast and air quality on the main navigation, with assistant tools, no key needed.
- [Markets](extensions/markets.md): cryptocurrency (OKX) and A-share, Hong Kong and US stock (Tencent) watchlist on the main navigation, price and volume charts, assistant tools and rate limits.
- [Telegram](extensions/telegram.md): login, inbox, archives, network requirements, tools and the `tg` CLI.
- [Discord](extensions/discord.md): your own bot as a read-only source: setting it up, what goes into the knowledge base and how nothing is skipped, the assistant tools, status, network and the sandbox.
- [X](extensions/x.md): two optional ways in: the official X API with your own developer app (mentions in the inbox, a daily-budgeted digest of your timeline or lists, cost and X's terms), or the `grok` CLI on the hub signed in with a SuperGrok or X Premium+ subscription (searches chosen accounts and topics, no X keys); read-only assistant tools and retention.
- [Bypass auto-allow (Claude Code)](extensions/agent-bypass-allow.md): auto-allow Claude Code's remaining Bash, read-only and subagent prompts in bypassPermissions sessions on chosen computers; deletion and overwriting ask unless inside temporary or work directories (or a setting allows them all); force pushes, permission changes and your own ask/deny rules still ask; audit log and limits.
- [ATS](../extensions/ats/README.md): an agent task queue for to-dos: the assistant queues a task (asks every time), the queue runs it as an agent session in a git worktree on a chosen computer by priority, difficulty and quota, runs the acceptance command and writes the outcome back to the to-do; read-only by default, repository allowlist, a queue page.
- [Disklessly](extensions/disklessly.md): fleet disk watermarks, rebuildable developer cache cleanup with `df`-measured freed space, dry-run plans, and coding-agent cold session tiering across local and SSH machines.
- [mnemo](../extensions/mnemo/README.md): let the Claude assistant search past coding-agent sessions through mnemo's MCP server, when mnemo is installed on its computer; read-only tools only.
- [Spaces](extensions/spaces.md): types, properties, relations and status flows you define yourself, with the overview card, views, four templates, rollups, derive and the assistant's seven tools; the MCP server needs the `spaces` binary on `PATH` or in `~/bin`, or `PERSONA_SPACES_BIN`.
- [Custom looks](extensions/custom-looks.md): five avatars (looks) with pictures, colors and status dots; images only. A hub pack of the same id wins until it is removed, and the chosen look carries on.
- [ChatGPT apps](extensions/chatgpt-apps.md): the apps connected to your ChatGPT account and the ChatGPT plugin marketplace for the assistant, through ChatGPT's own (non-public) web backend: device-code sign-in on the phone, read tools run directly, every change a `confirm_always` action approved on the phone, plugin pages, tokens only in the hub's encrypted secrets; terms and risk.
- [1Password](extensions/onepassword.md): your 1Password vaults through a service account, read-only: list vaults, find items by title, tag or website, see an item's fields and their `op://` references; the token checked before it is saved, values never leave the extension, redaction, status and limits.

## Developing and maintaining extensions

- [Development](development.md): repository layout, adding an extension, local checks and packaging.
- [Reference](reference.md): manifests, configuration, process protocol, SDK ownership and compatibility.
- [Releases and signing](releases.md): release automation, index format, verification and key management.

This repository documents its public extensions and build/release workflow. The [local reference](reference.md) links to the published SDK contracts and schemas; it does not rely on access to the host implementation repository.

## Example extensions

- [Showcase](extensions/showcase.md): a local-only component catalog, widget and shortcut examples, view snapshots and older-app fallbacks.
- [Starter kit and starter pack](extensions/starter-kit.md): runtime-free skills, assistant instructions, quick prompts, triage templates and a theme; a pack that installs starter-kit and LINUX DO together. These require a hub with declarative-contribution support (`engines.persona >=202611042338`).

These examples are available in `main` and the market. Keep both project READMEs and this index aligned when adding extensions.
