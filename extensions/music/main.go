// Command music is a Persona extension for music services. It contributes one connector per source and one page that
// aggregates them:
//
//   - connectors: one per service (Apple Music today), each with its endpoints: the account provider (catalog,
//     library, playlists, history, writes), the local Mac provider (Music.app through a program on the selected Mac)
//     and the iPhone provider (a snapshot the assistant reads through the phone's tools).
//   - ui (nav_page "music" and plugin_page "page"): all sources together, or one at a time: now playing, recently
//     played, library playlists, stats, search and playback controls where the source has them.
//
// The program is a provider framework: a source implements the capabilities it has, and the page and tools adapt. The
// same binary runs as the program on a Mac (args "node") and answers the hub's nodes.call there.
