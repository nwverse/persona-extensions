// The weekly merge of classes (design 5.0 step 3, 5.2): classes are opened one action at a time, so one kind of
// situation ends up split over classes worded differently, or opened around one event. Once a week each facet's
// classes are put to the model in batches (all of a facet's when they fit, else grouped by type; a person's card
// classes only with that person's), and what it groups is merged: members, counter-examples, counts, active days and
// scopes come together, every merge an event and undoable (Unmerge).
