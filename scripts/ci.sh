# What CI runs, runnable on any machine with Go, a C compiler (the race detector), Python 3 and (for release) gh:
#   scripts/ci.sh            the checks a pull request needs: documentation links, the repository layout (no
#                            package-manager file at the root), manifests, gofmt, the copied SDK's vet and tests,
#                            every Go module's tidiness, vet and tests with the race detector, every platform builds,
#                            indexes, and the indexes' signatures against market.pub (nwverse/persona#1848)
#   scripts/ci.sh release <base>    then release the extensions whose version changed since the git ref <base>
#                                   (a push to main: the last commit a release run finished for, else its "before");
#                                   a version merged but meant to wait is not released
#   scripts/ci.sh release <id>…     then release these (CI's manual run; extensions/<id> too). An argument that is
#                                   neither an extension nor a git commit fails the release, not selects them all
# A version is released once: one that has its release already is skipped, unless the index does not have it yet.
